# Escape Nexus — Online Escape Room (Team Project)

Escape Nexus is a web-based cooperative escape-room platform. Players join a session, explore themed rooms, inspect items, solve puzzles, and unlock doors to advance before the timer expires. This repo contains the documentation (spec + UML), JSON content fixtures that mirror the UML, and (when added) the application code.

## Repo Map
- `/docs` — Specification + UML Class & Sequence diagrams (**export to PDF** for submission). `.puml` sources included.
- `/json` — Content data (each file has ≥ 2 objects and mirrors fields in the UML).
- `/src` — (placeholder) application code.
- `/tests` — (optional) automated tests.

## How to Use the Docs
Open the `.puml` sources in PlantUML (or VS Code + PlantUML) and **Export → PDF** at full-page size for printing. Alternatively, re-draw in Lucidchart and export to PDF; include view links in your Blackboard comment.

## Submission Helper
- `/docs/specification.md` → export to `/docs/specification.pdf`
- `/docs/uml-class.puml` → export to `/docs/uml-class.pdf`
- `/docs/sequence-start-game.puml` → export to `/docs/sequence-start-game.pdf`
- `/docs/sequence-solve-locked-door.puml` → export to `/docs/sequence-solve-locked-door.pdf`
