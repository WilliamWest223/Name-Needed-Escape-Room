# Escape Nexus — Online Escape Room (Team Project)

Escape Nexus is a web-based cooperative escape-room platform. Players join a session, explore themed rooms, inspect items, solve puzzles, and unlock doors to advance before the timer expires. This repo contains the documentation (spec + UML), JSON content fixtures that mirror the UML, and (when added) the application code.

## Repo Map
- `/docs` — Specification + UML Class & Sequence diagrams in submission-ready PDF format.
- `/json` — Content data (each file has ≥ 2 objects and mirrors fields in the UML).
- `/src` — (placeholder) application code.
- `/tests` — (placeholder) automated tests.

## How to Use the Docs
Review the PDFs in `/docs` to ensure they remain full-page exports ready for printing. If you maintain Lucidchart diagrams, export fresh PDFs and include the share link in your Blackboard submission comment.
